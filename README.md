Heart rate alert system using smart watch is a innovative device that reads the person's heart rate, oxygen level and temperature then display it in mobile using Blynk app.

We used Arduino mini microcontroller with wifi module integrated in it. Along with this a heart rate sensor, temperature sensor and oxygen sensor connected to it.

Code takes the input of heart rate temperature and oxygen in real time.
